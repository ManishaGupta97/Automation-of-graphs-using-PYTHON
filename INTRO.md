Graphs Automation using python
Hey guys, 
In this jupyter notebook i have successfully automated a function which helps in plotting and saving graphs of all the columns in the data set. 
During EDA it's essential to look at graphs of all columns and doing it manually is tiresome. 
With this function you can plot and save all graphs in your chosen directory.

### 1. What is the problem and why do you want to solve it? 
Understanding the given dataset gives us a clear picture of the features and the relationships between them. One way is by plotting the columns to understand 
the relationship between them. But if the given datset has enormous amount of columns, plotting them one by one will be a huge task and slow down the analysis. 

### 2. How do you intend to solve it?
This problem could be solved by automating the process of plotting the graphs. A function must be created which accepts the dataset and allows the user to choose the 
columns they want to plot the graphs of. This function will help the user to speed up the process all together. 

### 3. What kind of output are you expecting?
The output must be histogram and boxplots for numeric columns and bar plot for any categorical column in the data. Later these graphs must automatically be 
saved to the directory mentioned by the user.
